Greenspam Email Filtering Program

Overview

The Greenspam project is a local spam filtering application developed in C#. The program uses ML.NET with the SDC Logistic Regression algorithm to classify and filter spam emails. Initially built as a standalone Windows program using Microsoft Visual Studio, the project is now being expanded to incorporate more advanced machine learning techniques and web-based capabilities.

Features

Email Classification: Utilizes machine learning to classify emails as spam or non-spam.

Pattern Filtering: Implements customizable filters to detect specific spam patterns.

Local Deployment: Operates as a desktop application for offline usage.

Machine Learning Integration: Integrates ML.NET for building and training logistic regression models.

Requirements

Development Environment: Microsoft Visual Studio (C#)

Framework: .NET Framework 4.7 or later

Dependencies:

ML.NET

System.Data.SqlClient (for any local database integration)

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/greenspam-project.git
cd greenspam-project

Open the project in Microsoft Visual Studio.

Restore NuGet packages for ML.NET:

Go to Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Manage NuGet Packages for Solution.

Install the necessary dependencies (e.g., ML.NET).

Build the project and run the application.

Usage

Training the Model

Import a labeled dataset (e.g., training_data.csv) into the program.

Use the built-in model training function to train a logistic regression model.

Save the trained model as a .zip file for reuse.

Filtering Emails

Load the trained logistic regression model into the application.

Use the pattern-matching feature to set additional filters.

Process emails to classify them as spam or non-spam.

Future Enhancements

Web-Based Interface: Transition to a React-based frontend and REST API backend.

Advanced Models: Incorporate deep learning techniques for better accuracy.

Cloud Integration: Enable online deployment for real-time email filtering.

Expanded Filtering Options: Add features to block emails based on domain reputation, IP blacklist, etc.
